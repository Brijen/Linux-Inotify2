NAME
    Linux::Inotify2 - scalable directory/file change notification

SYNOPSIS
     use Linux::Inotify2;

     # create a new object
     my $inotify = new Linux::Inotify2
        or die "Unable to create new inotify object: $!";
 
     # for Event:
     Event->io (fd =>$inotify->fileno, poll => 'r', cb => sub { $inotify->poll });
     # for Glib:
     add_watch Glib::IO $inotify->fileno, in => sub { $inotify->poll };
     # manually:
     1 while $inotify->poll;

     # add watchers
     $inotify->watch ("/etc/passwd", IN_ACCESS, sub {
        my $e = shift;
        my $name = $e->fullname;
        print "$name was accessed\n" if $e->IN_ACCESS;
        print "$name is no longer mounted\n" if $e->IN_UNMOUNT;
        print "$name is gone\n" if $e->IN_IGNORED;
        print "events for $name have been lost\n" if $e->IN_Q_OVERFLOW;
 
        # cancel this watcheR: remove no further events
        $e->w->cancel;
     });

DESCRIPTION
  The Linux::Inotify2 Class
    This module implements an interface to the Linux 2.6.13 and later
    Inotify file/directory change notification sytem.

    It has a number of advantages over the Linux::Inotify module:

       - it is portable (Linux::Inotify only works on x86)
       - the equivalent of fullname works correctly
       - it is better documented
       - it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for
         integration.

    my $inotify = new Linux::Inotify2
        Create a new notify object and return it. A notify object is kind of
        a container that stores watches on filesystem names and is
        responsible for handling event data.

        On error, "undef" is returned and $! will be set accordingly. The
        followign errors are documented:

         ENFILE   The system limit on the total number of file descriptors has been reached.
         EMFILE   The user limit on the total number of inotify instances has been reached.
         ENOMEM   Insufficient kernel memory is available.

        Example:

           my $inotify = new Linux::Inotify2
              or die "Unable to create new inotify object: $!";

    $watch = $inotify->watch ($name, $mask, $cb)
        Add a new watcher to the given notifier. The watcher will create
        events on the pathname $name as given in $mask, which can be any of
        the following constants (all exported by default) ORed together.

        "file" refers to any filesystem object in the watch'ed object
        (always a directory), that is files, directories, symlinks, device
        nodes etc., while "object" refers to the object the watch has been
        set on itself:

         IN_ACCESS            object was accessed
         IN_MODIFY            object was modified
         IN_ATTRIB            object metadata changed
         IN_CLOSE_WRITE       writable fd to file / to object was closed
         IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE     readonly fd to file / to object closed
         IN_OPEN              object was opened
         IN_MOVED_FROM        file was moved from this object (directory)
         IN_MOVED_TO          file was moved to this object (directory)
         IN_CREATE            file was created in this object (directory)
         IN_DELETE            file was deleted from this object (directory)
         IN_DELETE_SELF       object itself was deleted
         IN_ALL_EVENTS        all of the above events

         IN_ONESHOT           only send event once

         IN_CLOSE             same as IN_CLOSE_WRITE | IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
         IN_MOVE              same as IN_MOVED_FROM | IN_MOVED_TO

        $cb is a perl code reference that is called for each event. It
        receives a "Linux::Inotify2::Event" object.

        The returned $watch object is of class "Linux::Inotify2::Watch".

        On error, "undef" is returned and $! will be set accordingly. The
        following errors are documented:

         EBADF    The given file descriptor is not valid.
         EINVAL   The given event mask contains no legal events.
         ENOMEM   Insufficient kernel memory was available.
         ENOSPC   The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached or the kernel failed to allocate a needed resource.
         EACCESS  Read access to the given file is not permitted.

        Example, show when "/etc/passwd" gets accessed and/or modified once:

           $inotify->watch ("/etc/passwd", IN_ACCESS | IN_MODIFY, sub {
              my $e = shift;
              print "$e->{w}{name} was accessed\n" if $e->IN_ACCESS;
              print "$e->{w}{name} was modified\n" if $e->IN_MODIFY;
              print "$e->{w}{name} is no longer mounted\n" if $e->IN_UNMOUNT;
              print "events for $e->{w}{name} have been lost\n" if $e->IN_Q_OVERFLOW;

              $e->w->cancel;
           });

    $inotify->fileno
        Returns the fileno for this notify object. You are responsible for
        calling the "poll" method when this fileno becomes ready for
        reading.

    $count = $inotify->poll
        Reads events from the kernel and handles them. If the notify fileno
        is blocking (the default), then this method waits for at least one
        event (and thus returns true unless an error occurs). Otherwise it
        returns immediately when no pending events could be read.

        Returns the count of events that have been handled.

  The Linux::Inotify2::Event Class
    Objects of this class are handed as first argument to the watch
    callback. It has the following members and methods:

    $event->w
    $event->{w}
        The watcher object for this event.

    $event->name
    $event->{name}
        The path of the filesystem object, relative to the watch name.

    $watch->fullname
        Returns the "full" name of the relevant object, i.e. including the
        "name" component of the watcher.

    $event->mask
    $event->{mask}
        The received event mask. In addition the the events described for
        "$inotify-"watch>, the following flags (exported by default) can be
        set:

         IN_ISDIR             event object is a directory

         IN_Q_OVERFLOW        event queue overflowed

         # when the following flags are set, then watchers are canceled automatically
         IN_UNMOUNT           filesystem for watch'ed object was unmounted
         IN_IGNORED           file was ignored/is gone (no more events are delivered)

    $event->IN_xxx
        Returns a boolean that returns true if the event mask matches the
        event. All of the "IN_xxx" constants can be used as methods.

    $event->cookie
    $event->{cookie}
        The event cookie, can be used to synchronize two related events.

  The Linux::Inotify2::Watch Class
    Watch objects are created by calling the "watch" method of a notifier.

    It has the following members and methods:

    $watch->name
    $watch->{name}
    The name as specified in the "watch" call. For the object itself, this
    is the empty string. For directory watches, this is the name of the
    entry without leading path elements.

    $watch->mask
    $watch->{mask}
    The mask as specified in the "watch" call.

    $watch->cb ([new callback])
    $watch->{cb}
    The callback as specified in the "watch" call. Can optionally be
    changed.

    $watch->cancel
    Cancels/removes this watch. Future events, even if already queued
    queued, will not be handled and resources will be freed.
